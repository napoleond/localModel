localModel.js is meant to simplify the process of syncing a user's data to the server after offline use as well as reducing load time when a user requests a large collection of models. localModel.js does NOT merge model edits - it merely chooses which version of the model to keep and then saves it both on the server and in localStorage. Model saves are queued and batched - localModel attempts to group models of the same type and send them to the server as a collection to reduce HTTP overhead. This is especially efficient in the case where the user is uploading larger files from the application while editing model data - localModel will wait for the file to upload while grouping model edits and sending them off when the file is finished. It is being developed and is best suited for the type of application where each user can only edit their own data, and even in that situation the user might not always agree with the version that localModel decides to keep (think concurrent sessions for the same user, etc) so it's important to understand the limitations of localModel before using it in production.
